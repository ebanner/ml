1D and vectorized implementations of the following discriminative models:

- Linear Regression
- Softmax
- Fully-Connected Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network

I was inspired to implement these models after reading Andrev Karpathy's fantastic [backpropagation intuitions tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/). Thanks Andrev!
